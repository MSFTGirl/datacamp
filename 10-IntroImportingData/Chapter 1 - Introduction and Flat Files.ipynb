    "## Chapter 1 - Introduction and Flat Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files can be documents with plain text, like the first chapter of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn or text files with records\n",
    "or table data where each row in a unique record and each column is a characteristic or feature of the record. The text files with table data are known as a flat file. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading a Text File\n",
    "Reading a plain text file can be done with Python's basic open() function to open a connection to the file. You assign the file name to a variable as a string, and assign the opened file to a variable that passes the file name variable to the function open() and also pass the argument mode = 'r' to ensure the document is opened in read-only mode. mode = 'w' allows you to open a file so you can write to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then use the .read() method to the opened file variable and assign that to a new variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, close the connection to the file using the .close() method on the open file variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing a Text File\n",
    "You can use the print() function to print the variable assigned to read the opened file. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context Manager with()\n",
    "By using a with statement, you can avoid having to close the file manually. The with statement creates a context and allows you to execute commands with the file once it is opened. Once out of the with clause or context, the connection to the file is automatically closed. With the with construct, you are bounding the open file to a variable, in this case: file."

      "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n",
      "There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n",
      "Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\n",
      "But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling And there they stand- miles of them- leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets avenues- north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n",
      "Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries- stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\n",
      "But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- what is the one charm wanting?- Water- there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n",
      "Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don't sleep of nights- do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;- no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,- though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board- yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;- though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.\n",
      "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.\n",
      "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about- however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.\n",
      "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,- what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\n",
      "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way- he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:\n",
      "\"Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. \"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\" \"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\n",
      "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces- though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\n",
      "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it- would they let me- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.\n",
      "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Flat Files\n",
    "Flat Files are text files with table data have rows that are unique records and columns that are attributes or features of each record and do not have structured relationships. Flat files often have a Header, which is row that occurs as the first row and describes the contents of the data columns. Knowing if your file has a header is important, as it may alter how you import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat files are important to data scientists because they often think in rows or records.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Extensions\n",
    "Flat files, like the sample titanic.csv file, have the file extension .csv which stands for comma separated value where the values for each row are separated by commas. Other character(s) can be used to separate values in a flat file, items like spaces or tabs and these separators are referred to as delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common file extension is .txt for text files. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Do You Import Flat Files?\n",
    "If the file consists entirely of numbers and you want to store them as a NumPy array, you can use the NumPy and if you would rather store the data in a DataFrame, then you use Pandas. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Importing Flat Files Using NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is all numerical, you will want to use the NumPy array to import. NumPy arryas are the default standard for numerical data, as they are efficient, fast and clean. In addition, other packages like Scikit-learn depend on NumPy arrays. loadtxt() and genfromtxt() NumPy functions make is easy to load data into NumPy arrays. When using loadtxt(), you have to first import NumPy and then pass the filename as the first argument and the delimiter as the second. The default delimiter for loadtxt() is any white space, so in this case we will specify the delimiter as a comma (,). \n",
    "\n",
    "Other arguments to consider include:\n",
    "skiprows =  - If your data file has a header row with text describing the column attributes, then using the skiprows argument will be needed to specify which row or rows contains the header data, usually skiprows = 1 is sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "usecols =  - If you only want to import specific columns, say 1 - 3, then you use this argument with square brackets to specify the index of the columns to use, remembering that NumPy uses 0 based indexing, so in this case it would be usecols = [0,2].\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype =  - If you want to use different data types, you can use the dtype argument, e.g. dtype = str or dtype = float. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mixed Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is great for basic cases where all the data is numeric, but tends to break down when you have mixed data types in your flat file. The natural place for such data is the Pandas DataFrame. "

    "#### Working with mixed datatypes (1)\n",
    "Much of the time you will need to import datasets which have different datatypes in different columns; one column may contain strings and another floats, for example. The function np.loadtxt() will freak at this. There is another function, np.genfromtxt(), which can handle such structures. If we pass dtype=None to it, it will figure out what types each column should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import 'titanic.csv' using the function np.genfromtxt() as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> data = np.genfromtxt('titanic.csv', delimiter=',', names=True, dtype=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the first argument is the filename, the second specifies the delimiter , and the third argument names tells us there is a header. Because the data are of different types, data is an object called a structured array. Because numpy arrays have to contain elements that are all the same type, the structured array solves this by being a 1D array, where each element of the array is a row of the flat file imported. You can test this by checking out the array's shape in the shell by executing np.shape(data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing rows and columns of structured arrays is super-intuitive: to get the ith row, merely execute data[i] and to get the column with name 'Fare', execute data['Fare'].\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just used np.genfromtxt() to import data containing mixed datatypes. There is also another function np.recfromcsv() that behaves similarly to np.genfromtxt(), except that its default dtype is None. In this exercise, you'll practice using this to achieve the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Instructions:__\n",

    "### Importing Flat Files from Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are not able to fulfill a basic data science requirement: to have two dimensional, labeled data structures that potentially could have different data types that many data science activities like manipulate, slice, reshape, groupby, join, merge can be completed or perform statistics in a missing value friendly manner or work with time series. For that we need to use the Pandas package. Pandas enables users to carry out data analysis and modeling workflow in Python. The most common data structure used by Pandas is the DataFrame. It is the pythonic analog of the R dataframe. "
